# ClassFolderHierarchy
I made this batch file to automaticly make folders for a college session.

For now it is only available in french as i made it for personal use.

It was originally made in the winter of 2016.

I later made a [C# version of it](https://github.com/ultreson/ClassFolderHierarchyGUI).
